Implementation of LSTM Cells for MNIST Classification


This repository contains two implementations of MNIST classification using Recurrent Neural Network methodologies which can be classified as foolows
1. Long Short Term Memory (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608005001206)
It features three gates (input, forget, output), block
input, a single cell (the Constant Error Carousel), an output
activation function, and peephole connections1. The output of
the block is recurrently connected back to the block input and
all of the gates.
